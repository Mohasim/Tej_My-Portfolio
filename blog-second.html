              <p><img src="images/Future of Internal Audit.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
              <p>Today’s businesses must be constantly evolving to meet changing business models, new regulatory requirements, technology innovations, and an increase in cyberattacks. To help businesses meet these new challenges, internal audit (IA) functions must evolve as well. While internal audit is not the sole owner of risk within an organization, it provides unbiased insight into an organization’s internal controls, corporate governance, and business processes. IA educates board members and executives on the business risks and their impact, helping detect and address issues before they are identified by external audit.</p>
              <p>As data and technology permeate every aspect of the modern organization, IA departments can no longer work alone. IA teams must expand their skillsets and work alongside other departments to more effectively reduce risk, improve controls, and identify inefficiencies within the organization. While 2020 has already brought significant changes to the audit industry, 2021 provides the opportunity for even more. Here are the top 10 trends we expect to see for the internal audit world in 2021:</p>
              
              <h3>1. Privacy compliance will be a key focus for internal audit.</h3>
              
              <p>Over the past few years, the world has seen a massive increase in data privacy regulations at the state and national levels. Many organizations are struggling to keep up with these regulations, trying to untangle a growing number of legislative, regulatory, and internal requirements to demonstrate compliance. </p>
              <p>With the potential for more privacy regulations in 2021, internal audit needs to stay informed of these changes and develop a better understanding of potential privacy risks, so it can be more actively involved in identifying compliance risks and establishing the appropriate controls to mitigate those risks. IA must start incorporating privacy considerations into its enterprise risk assessments and determine how equipped the organization is to respond to new regulations as well as sustain ongoing compliance.</p>
              <p>As part of these privacy efforts, internal audit is responsible for validating the organization’s data classification policy. To do this, IA will need to review the processes for collecting, analyzing, storing, and sharing personal information to ensure compliance with current and new data regulations. By gaining a thorough understanding of these processes, internal audit will help enable the identification of current and emerging risks, giving shape to a privacy roadmap for future compliance efforts.</p>
              <p></p>

              <h3>2. New cybersecurity regulations will require more internal audit involvement.</h3>

              <p>Cyber threats are continuing to increase in frequency and complexity, with each day bringing the potential of another data breach. To hold public companies accountable to their stockholders and investors, government pressuring public organizations to clearly demonstrate how they are mitigating cyber risks, including key internal controls.</p>
              <p>These compliance requirements push internal auditors into the world of cybersecurity. From required board oversight to data incident disclosures to insider trading regulation, internal audit must evaluate the existing policies that address the requirements from external bodies and show external auditors that adequate controls are in place. A few key steps auditors can take to help ensure compliance include:</p>
              <p>• Revisit and, if necessary, refresh data-security public disclosures to ensure compliance with the new guidance</p>
              <p>•Consider the adequacy of internal controls and procedures for identifying cybersecurity risks and incidents as part of the design and effectiveness of a company’s disclosure controls and procedures</p>
              <p>•Update existing enterprise-wide data security policies, plans, and procedures</p>
              <p>•Ensure that controls are in place to escalate cyber risk, incident engagement, and oversight by senior corporate leaders and the board</p>
              <p>•Review data security incident disclosure processes to ensure key stakeholders are notified of significant data security incidents and establish a decision-making process and protocol to timely disclose material cybersecurity incidents</p>
              <p>•Revise codes of conduct and internal securities trading policies to ensure that, as appropriate, securities trading restrictions are put in place upon the detection of a material cybersecurity incident</p>
              <p>•Regularly testing security controls, policies, and processes and making improvements as needed to help reduce the likelihood of a security incident</p>
              
              <h3>3. Boards will become more involved in cybersecurity.</h3>

              <p>By providing an independent, objective evaluation of an organization’s existing controls, internal audit plays a crucial role in helping organizations manage potential cyber threats. However, with cyberattacks on the rise, security breaches at an all-time high, and new pressures from the government, cybersecurity is now becoming a top priority in boardroom discussions.Board members want to gain a comprehensive view of the risks both inside and outside of the organization, boards will rely more heavily on Chief Audit Executives (CAEs) and their IA team to communicate these risks and effective methods for countering them.</p>
              <p>During these discussions, IA will need to educate board members on the steps taken to test the organization’s cybersecurity program to validate its effectiveness. Utilizing their knowledge of industry trends, risk management best practices, and business strategies, the IA team will recommend solutions to handle any detected risks before they become too large to address. Boards looking to remain highly engaged in matters of cybersecurity and cyber threats will find a useful partner in internal audit.</p>

              <h3>4. More internal audit departments will use cybersecurity frameworks. </h3>
              
              <p>One of internal audit’s objectives is to provide management with an independent assessment of an organization’s cybersecurity policies and procedures and their effectiveness. IA identifies regulatory deficiencies that could put the organization at risk, as well as the necessary internal controls to mitigate them. More than ever, organizations must balance the evolving threat landscape against their security program. In the coming year, this will be seen more often through the adoption of a cybersecurity control framework, which can serve as a baseline for an organization’s existing program. </p>
              <p>When determining which framework to use, internal auditors will need to take into account industry standards, regulatory guidance, legal requirements, and the advantages and disadvantages of each framework. The selected framework will provide the structure, methodology, and best practices to achieve a strong security posture and prevent potential security vulnerabilities or data breaches. As an organization’s third line of defense, internal audit must play a key role in developing a strong cybersecurity program through an established cybersecurity framework to ensure a reliable, systematic way to mitigate cyber risk, regardless of how complex the environment.</p>

              <h3>5. Third-party risk management will become a concern.</h3>

              <p>Reliance on third-party vendors for essential business functions continues to grow. According to the Ponemon Institute, companies share confidential information with an average of 583 third parties, and approximately 59% of companies say they’ve experienced a data breach in the past year due to a third party or vendor. Many organizations are unsure where their data goes or who has access to it once it is shared with a third party, which can lead to noncompliance, penalties, legal action, and reputational damage.</p>
              <p>As third-party relationships increase an organization’s exposure to new risks, formalizing an effective third-party risk management (TPRM) program to mitigate these risks will become a common practice in 2021. Internal audit can assist in this process by:</p>
              <p>•Reviewing the existing TPRM program to assess processes and controls, including third-party selection, contract negotiation, ongoing monitoring, and vendor termination</p>
              <p>•Validating that the TPRM program is meeting organizational concerns in various areas, such as data privacy, cybersecurity, contracts, business strategy, etc.</p>
              <p>•Evaluating management’s oversight of vendor performance and contractual obligations with the third party</p>
              <p>•Detecting critical or high-risk third parties and ensuring they are evaluated and monitored more frequently   </p>
              <p>•Conducting an assessment of third-party risk management controls and recommending opportunities for improvement on lacking controls</p>

              <h3>6. Internal audit will play a key role in digital business transformation. </h3>

              <p>To keep up with the needs of an increasingly digital workplace, many organizations are going through a digital transformation, implementing new technologies and processes to make the business more efficient. For example, intelligent automation such as robotic process automation (RPA) is continuing to expand at a rapid clip and will play a key role in many businesses in 2021</p>
              <p>RPA allows for tasks to be completed in a systematic manner, free from any variation, increasing efficiency and accuracy. As companies start this business transformation, internal audit must remain cognizant of the risks these technological changes bring with them. Despite the value that tools like RPA can bring, IA will need to help guide the company when considering the following:</p>
              <p>•How will access to data and systems be handled?</p>
              <p>•What controls will be put in place to monitor the performance of these tools?</p>
              <p>•Who will design and monitor the controls?</p>
              <p>•What processes will be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to these new systems and their sensitive data?</p>
